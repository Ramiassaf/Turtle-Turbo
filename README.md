# Turtle-Turbo
This Python code creates a simple game called "Turbo Turtle" using the Turtle graphics module. In the game, the player controls a turtle character that moves up the screen while avoiding cars that move across the screen. The player scores points by reaching the other end of the screen and levels up as the game progresses.

The game is run in a continuous loop, with a sleep time of 0.1 seconds between each iteration. Within the loop, the turtle character and the cars are moved across the screen, and collision detection is performed to check if the player has collided with any of the cars. If a collision occurs, the game is over and the final score is displayed. If the player reaches the other end of the screen, the speed of the cars increases and the score is updated.

The game consists of several Python classes:

The Player class, which defines the turtle character and its movements.
The CarManager class, which manages the cars that move across the screen.
The Scoreboard class, which displays the player's score and level.
The Screen class, which sets up the game window and listens for user input.
The code is well-structured and easy to read, with comments explaining the purpose of each line of code. It provides a good example of how to use the Turtle graphics module to create a simple game in Python.
